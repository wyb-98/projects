# A Quantitative Comparison of Ainu Applicatives and Postpositions

## Background on Ainu

Ainu is a critically endangered language that, at one point, was spoken across Hokkaido, as well as northern Honshu, the Kuril Islands and Sakhalin.  Currently, only a few, elderly speakers remain in Hokkaido. (Bugaeva 2017)

## Overview of Ainu Polysynthesis

One feature that marks the Ainu language as unique among the languages of Japan is its polysynthetic nature.  Japanese, while it shares complex, agglutinating verb morphology with Ainu, must use an analytic structure where Ainu would be able to incorporate oblique verbal arguments within the verb.

### 1. Ainu (Polysynthetic):
Cep-ya-o-kuta-an

fish-shore-to.APPL-throw-IND.s

“I threw the fish [he caught] onto the shore” (Bugaeva 2017, p.4)

### 2. compare with Japanese:

Kare-ga tsukamaeta sakana-wo riku-ni watashi-ga nageta.

3SG.NOM catch.PAST fish.ACC  shore.DAT  1SG.NOM  throw.PAST

“I threw the fish he caught to the shore”

However, as seen in NINJAL’s “A Topical Dictionary of Conversational Ainu”, which is based on the *Ainugo Kaiwa Jiten* (Ainu conversational dictionary) by Kotora Jinbo and Shōzaburō Kanazawa (1898), constructions like this are also possible in Ainu:

### 3. Ainu:

Toani un arpa.

That-place to go.SG

“Go to that place” (Translation provided by NINJAL: “Go over there”)

## Methodology

In Anna Bugaeva’s 2017 paper, Polysynthesis in Ainu, the author asserts the following about Ainu’s case postpositions: “...most case postpositions originate in verbs and are still in an early stage of grammaticalization because they can be used independently...” (Bugaeva 2017, p. 31).  While this says nothing about the motivation behind Ainu developing postpositions, given the extensive historical contact scenario Ainu had with Japanese, a language which has an extremely robust case postposition system, I speculate that this developed or increased in its frequency of usage at least in part due to Japanese influence.

Furthermore, Bugaeva states the following about Ainu applicatives: “… exuberant frequency of applicatives in the *Yukar* ‘heroic epic’, which is the oldest genre of Ainu oral literature …” (Bugaeva 2017, p.47).
The hypothesis I would like to test is the following: is it possible to show, via quantitative methods, the increase in the relative frequency of postpositions in Ainu, and a corresponding decrease in the usage of the applicative.
gmTo test this, I decided to narrow the scope of which oblique arguments I would be looking at, mainly due to the diversity of roles that applicative arguments can take on.  The oblique arguments I focused on were the following: physical location, physical source, physical goal, temporal location, and temporal source.

As locational postpositions were observed referring to places in time via a metaphor to physical location, I decided to include the last two categories: temporal location, which denotes a time at which some action occurred, or temporal source, which denotes a span of time, occuring after some event, in which another event took place (e.g. I ate after I sat down: the action of sitting down > the action of eating).
The particular morphemes which introduced these arguments were the following:

### Postpositions

- *-un* (frequently translated as English 'to')
- *-wa* (frequently translated as English 'from')
- *-ta* (frequently translated as English 'at')

### Applicatives

- *o-* (called the *o-* locative by Bugaeva, frequently translated as English 'to' or 'at')
- *e-* (called the *e-* instrumental by Bugaeva, used a wide variety of thematic roles)
- *ko-* (called *ko-* dative by Bugaeva, also used a variety of roles)

<br>

The collection I drew my data from was the *Annotated Folklore Texts of the Chitose Dialect of Ainu Recited by Ito Oda*, collected by Anna Bugaeva during the span of July 1998- June 2000, and recited by Ito Oda, a speaker of the Ainu variety spoken around Chitose, a city southeast of Hokkaido’s capital Sapporo.  The collection includes 6 Kamuy *Yukar* (epics of the Gods), and 9 *uwepeker* (folktales).  Based off of Bugaeva’s assertion in her 2017 work, I worked off of the assumption that the *Yukar* occupied the oldest layer of the Ainu oral literature, and represented a relatively linguistically conservative form of the language. (Bugaeva 2004)

Every time one of the 6 morphemes mentioned above (the three postpositions, and the three applicative affixes) were used in a manner that fit one of the five categories (physical location, source or goal, and temporal location and source) within the text, they were added to the total tally, differentiating based on whether they appeared in one of the *Yukar* or *uwepeker*.  There were some limited cases in which one of the affixes was used, in a highly lexicalized context, in which the criteria to be counted (namely being a location, goal or source in space or time) were not obvious from the glosses or translation.  These cases were omitted from the total counts.

|Applicative |    10.2 %|  31.5 %|


## Analysis

From a quick glance at the data, one thing is apparent in relation to the distribution of oblique arguments encoding temporal data, i.e. they are categorically conveyed using postpostional forms.  Thus including the two temporal categories (location and source) would only serve to artificially inflate the usage frequency of postpositions.  Furthermore, the extremely high number of the temporal source items in the *uwepeker* is explained by the conventional structure of Ainu folktales.  The phrase: wa, or-o-wa-(no) (gloss: and, there-POSS-from-(ADV)) is frequently used as a transition from one line to the next, roughly translating to: and then, or and after that event.  The folktale’s narrative structure makes extensive use this as a transition, which further inflates the number of postpositions counted in the *uwepeker*.  Thus, in an attempt to provide an analysis that is less affected by these conflating variables, the following table shows the usage rates of postpositions versus applicatives, limited to just the appearances of the affixes when used to denote a physical location of some sort (loc., goal or source)

Adjusted usage percentages:

|            |*uwepeker*|*Yukar* |
|------------|----------|--------|
|Postposition|    82.9 %|  64.0 %|
|Applicative |    17.1 %| 35.94 %|

Even when limiting the scope to instances of oblique arguments encoding a physical location only, there is a substantial difference in the usage rates between the *Yukar* and the *uwepeker*.  This appears to support Bugaeva’s claims about the relatively more frequent use of the applicative in the *Yukar*.

## Addressing Data Quantity/Quality

One major issue that arose during data collection was the overall low token counts for almost every category, in both the *Yukar* and the *uwepeker*.  Besides the -ta and -un postpositions, most of the other affixes rarely appeared in double digit frequencies.  Furthermore, there were many more total tokens in the *uwepeker* than in the *Yukar*, making it hard to assert any claim about the *Yukar* due to the possibility of sampling bias.

Furthermore, due to Ainu literature’s oral status, it must be taken into consideration that the narrator’s own idiolect may have a heavy influence on the language of the narration, i.e. if the narrator was exposed to a form of Ainu with a high usage of postpositions to encode locational data, this is most likely going to be reflected in their narration of the oral epics, possibly despite the fact that the original epic contained a much lower frequency of postpositions

## Conclusion

While the possibility that sampling bias accounts for the discrepancies between the frequencies must be taken into consideration at all times, there are a number of noteworthy trends in the data worth discussing.  First, across the board, the most used affixes in encoding locational data in Ito Oda’s idiolect of Ainu are the -ta and -un postpositions.  In the *uwepeker*, these two postpositions accounted for 79.43% of affixes used to denote location.

In the *Yukar*, -ta remained the most frequently used affix for location, however, -un was edged out by the applicative affix ko-.  One thing that is worth noting about this is that the applicative affix in the *uwepeker* most commonly used to denote location was o-, and it was almost exclusively used to denote a pure locative, with one instance of it being used as a source.  In the *Yukar*, of o-’s six appearances, four (66%) denoted the goal of an action, a role which is categorically occupied by postpositions in the *uwepeker*.  While the token count is extremely low, thus any conclusions drawn are tenuous at best, the semantic shift of the o-, which is both used to introduce  location and goal in the *Yukar*, narrowing down almost exclusively to location in the *uwepeker* is worth noting.  Of the 23 applicatives used for locational information in the *Yukar*, 7 (30.4%) were encoding the goal of a verb of motion, which shifts to 0% usage in the *uwepeker*, with goal being denoted solely by postpositions.
